# MsB(SecureSpeed)

# Introduction

In recent years, the use of blockchain technology has grown rapidly, with many companies and organizations looking to utilize its potential to revolutionize the way we conduct business and manage assets. Among the most popular blockchain platforms is Bitcoin, which is widely considered to be the first and most successful application of blockchain technology. However, despite its popularity and success, Bitcoin has several limitations that have prevented it from achieving widespread adoption. These limitations include slow transaction speeds and a lack of security.
SecureSpeed is a decentralized payment channel that enables fast, secure and low-cost transactions between two parties.

Our proposed solution is a smart contract that can be built on top of the Bitcoin network to provide increased speed and security for Bitcoin transactions.
SecureSpeed uses a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain that stores the payment channel data and implements the logic for managing the channel. The smart contract allows users to deposit funds, withdraw funds, update their deposit, initiate transactions, and resolve disputes.

SecureSpeed also integrates an external oracle contract to resolve disputes between the parties involved in a payment channel. The oracle contract can be any contract that implements the resolveDispute(address user1, address user2) function, which returns a tuple of a boolean and a uint.

# Background

Bitcoin transactions are processed by a decentralized network of nodes that follow a set of consensus rules. These rules dictate the way the network processes transactions and confirms them in the blockchain. However, the current process for confirming transactions is slow and can take several minutes to complete. Additionally, the decentralized nature of the network also introduces security risks, as transactions can be subject to double-spending and other forms of fraud.

Our smart contract solution addresses these limitations by creating a "lightning network" on top of the Bitcoin network. This lightning network allows participants to open payment channels with one another and make multiple transactions without having to broadcast each one to the entire network. By keeping transactions off-chain, the speed of transactions is greatly increased. Additionally, smart contract can be used to create multisignature wallets, this allows for more secure storage of bitcoin, by requiring more than one signature to authorize a transaction.

# Problem Statement

Current blockchain-based payment systems have several limitations such as high transaction costs, slow transaction times, and lack of privacy. SecureSpeed aims to overcome these limitations by creating a decentralized payment channel that allows users to transact directly with each other, without the need for a central intermediary.

# Technical details

The SecureSpeed contract is written in Solidity, and it's compiled with version 0.11.0. The contract uses a mapping to store the payment channel data, which is organized as a two-dimensional mapping, where the first key is the address of the first user, and the second key is the address of the second user. Each channel is represented by a struct that contains the following fields:

address user1: the address of the first user
address user2: the address of the second user
uint deposit: the deposit in the channel
bool closed: a flag that indicates whether the channel is closed or not

The contract has several functions that allow users to interact with the payment channel:

deposit(address user, uint value): allows a user to deposit funds into the channel.
withdraw(address user, uint value): allows a user to withdraw funds from the channel.
updateDeposit(address user, uint value): allows a user to update the deposit in the channel.
initiateTransaction(address user1, address user2, address recipient, uint value, bytes memory signature1, bytes memory signature2): allows users to initiate a transaction between them, where signature1 is the signature of the first user, and signature2 is the signature of the second user.
resolveDispute(address user1, address user2): allows the parties involved in the channel to resolve a dispute by calling the external oracle contract.
closeChannel(address user1, address user2): allows the parties involved in the channel to close the channel when the deposit is zero.
updateChannel(address user1, address user2, uint newDeposit): allows the parties involved in the channel to update the deposit in the channel.
executeTransaction(address user1, address user2, address recipient, uint value, bytes memory signature1, bytes memory signature2): allows the parties involved in the channel to execute a transaction.


The contract also includes a function for opening payment channels between participants. Once a payment channel is open, participants can make multiple transactions without having to broadcast each one to the entire network. This greatly increases the speed of transactions and reduces the number of transactions that need to be confirmed on the blockchain.

# Benefits

Fast transaction times: since the transactions are off-chain, they are much faster than on-chain transactions.

Increased privacy: since the transactions are off-chain, they are not visible on the blockchain, which increases the privacy of the parties involved.

Flexibility: the external oracle contract allows for greater flexibility in resolving disputes, as it can be customized to suit the needs of the parties involved.

Security: the use of signatures and the integration of an external oracle contract provide an added layer of security, as they ensure that only the parties involved in the channel can initiate transactions and resolve disputes.
Conclusion

Our smart contract provides a solution to the limitations of the Bitcoin network by increasing the speed and security of transactions. By creating a lightning network and multisignature wallets on top of the Bitcoin network, we believe that our smart contract can play a significant role in the widespread adoption of Bitcoin and other blockchain-based platforms. We look forward to continuing to develop and refine our smart contract in the future, and we welcome feedback from the community on how to improve it.

# Scalability

Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work or load. In the context of blockchain, scalability refers to a network's ability to handle a large number of transactions per second (TPS) and maintain low transaction fees.

The SecureSpeed contract utilizes payment channels to improve scalability. Payment channels allow for multiple transactions to occur off-chain, with the final state being recorded on-chain. This reduces the number of transactions that need to be processed on the blockchain, thus improving scalability and transaction speed.

By using payment channels, the SecureSpeed contract is able to handle a large number of transactions without putting a significant load on the blockchain. This is because the contract only needs to record the opening and closing of the payment channel, and any disputes that may arise, on-chain. All the other transactions occur off-chain, which reduces the number of transactions that need to be processed on the blockchain.

Additionally, payment channels also allow for micropayments and fast recurring payments without incurring high transaction fees. This makes the contract suitable for use cases such as micropayments, subscriptions, and other scenarios that require fast and low-cost transactions.

Overall, the use of payment channels in the SecureSpeed contract improves scalability by reducing the load on the blockchain and enabling fast and low-cost transactions.

# Security

Security refers to the protection of a system or assets from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. In the context of blockchain, security refers to the measures taken to protect the integrity and confidentiality of transactions and the assets stored in smart contracts.

The SecureSpeed contract includes various security mechanisms to ensure the safety of the transactions and the funds stored in the contract. These mechanisms include:

Dispute Resolution: The contract includes a dispute resolution mechanism that utilizes an external oracle. This allows the contract to resolve disputes between the parties in a trustless manner, without relying on a centralized authority. The contract can use the external oracle to check the status of the channel and the balance of the parties and make the final decision.

Error and Exception handling: The contract includes a mechanism for handling errors and exceptions, which helps to prevent malicious actors from exploiting vulnerabilities in the contract. This allows the contract to handle unexpected situations and prevent loss of funds.

Signature Verification: The contract includes a mechanism for verifying the signatures of the parties involved in the transaction. This ensures that only the parties that have the right to initiate and execute transactions can do so, and helps to prevent unauthorized access to the funds stored in the contract.

Privacy: The contract includes features that enable private and confidential transactions, such as zero-knowledge proofs. These features allow users to perform transactions without revealing their identity or the details of the transaction, which increase the security level of the transactions

Overall, the SecureSpeed contract takes multiple measures to ensure the safety and security of the transactions and the funds stored in the contract. It utilizes a trustless dispute resolution mechanism, handles errors and exceptions, verifies the signatures of the parties, and enables private and confidential transactions, to provide a high level of security for the users.

Additionally, the contract can also be integrated with other decentralized applications and platforms, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and wallets. This allows users to interact with the contract directly from their wallets or DEXs, providing a seamless experience for the users.

The contract can also communicate with other protocols, such as the Interledger Protocol (ILP), which enables interoperability between different ledgers and payment systems. This allows the contract to connect with other payment systems and networks, allowing users to perform cross-chain transactions and access new markets.

Overall, the SecureSpeed contract is designed to be highly interoperable, which allows it to be integrated with other decentralized applications, platforms, and protocols, providing a seamless experience for the users and enabling cross-chain transactions.

# Privicy

Privacy refers to the ability of a system to protect personal information and keep it confidential. In the context of blockchain, privacy refers to the measures taken to protect the identity and personal information of users, as well as the details of transactions.

The SecureSpeed contract includes several privacy features that enable private and confidential transactions. These features include:

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs): The contract uses ZKPs to enable private transactions by allowing users to prove possession of certain information without revealing the actual information. This allows the contract to confirm the authenticity of the transactions without revealing the details of the transaction.

Ring signatures: The contract uses ring signatures to enable confidential transactions by allowing a group of users to sign a transaction without revealing which user actually signed it. This allows the contract to confirm the authenticity of the transactions without revealing the identity of the parties involved.

Bulletproofs: The contract uses bulletproofs to enable confidential transactions by allowing users to hide the amounts involved in the transactions. This allows the contract to confirm the authenticity of the transactions without revealing the amount involved.

Privacy-preserving smart contracts: The contract can be implemented using privacy-preserving smart contracts, which are smart contracts that are designed to protect the privacy of the users by hiding their identities and the details of the transactions.

These features help to protect the identity and personal information of the users, as well as the details of the transactions, which in turn increases the security level and ensures that the contract and the transactions performed on it are private and confidential.

Overall, the SecureSpeed contract includes several privacy features that enable private and confidential transactions, such as zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, bulletproofs, and privacy-preserving smart contracts, which help to protect the identity and personal information of the users, as well as the details of the transactions.

# Fee Structure

A fee structure refers to the way a system or application charges fees to its users. In the context of blockchain, a fee structure refers to the way a smart contract or decentralized application (dApp) charges transaction fees to its users.

The SecureSpeed contract includes a fee structure that allows it to charge transaction fees to its users. The fee structure is designed to balance the needs of the contract with the needs of the users, and it includes the following features:

Fixed transaction fee: The contract charges a fixed transaction fee for each transaction. This fee is used to cover the cost of executing the transaction on the blockchain and to provide a revenue stream for the contract.

Fee cap: The contract includes a maximum fee cap to prevent users from being charged excessive fees. This helps to ensure that the transaction fees are reasonable and affordable for users.

Fee discount: The contract may offer a fee discount to users who use specific tokens or platforms to interact with the contract. This helps to incentivize users to use specific tokens or platforms, and it can also help to reduce the overall transaction fees for users.

Fee revenue distribution: The contract may use a portion of the transaction fees to support the development and maintenance of the contract. This helps to ensure that the contract can continue to operate and improve over time.

Fee transparency: The contract includes mechanisms to make the fee structure transparent to users, such as displaying the transaction fee before a transaction is executed. This helps to ensure that users are aware of the fees they are paying and can make informed decisions about whether to use the contract.

The SecureSpeed contract charges a small percentage of the total value of each payment as a transaction fee. The exact percentage may vary depending on the specific implementation of the contract, but it is typically between 0.01% to 1% of the total value of the payment. This percentage is used to cover the costs associated with executing the transaction and maintaining the contract.

The maximum fee cap is typically set at a percentage of the total value of the payment that is higher than the fixed transaction fee, but still reasonable and fair. For example, it can be set at 5% of the total value of the payment. This ensures that users are not charged excessive fees for large payments.

The fee discounts are typically offered to users who hold a certain amount of tokens or for users who make a large number of transactions. The percentage of the fee discount may vary depending on the specific implementation of the contract, but it typically ranges from 10% to 50%.

In terms of revenue distribution, typically, a percentage of the transaction fees is used to reward the investors and the rest is used for the further development and maintenance of the contract. For example, 80% of the transaction fees may be used to reward the investors and 20% may be used for further development and maintenance of the contract.

It's worth noting that the exact percentage values may vary based on the specific implementation of the contract, and these are examples of how the percentages may be set. The important thing is that the fee structure is transparent, fair, and reasonable for the users while ensuring that the contract is sustainable and secure.

Overall, the SecureSpeed contract includes a fee structure that allows it to charge transaction fees to its users. The fee structure is designed to balance the needs of the contract with the needs of the users, and it includes features such as fixed transaction fee, fee cap, fee discount, fee revenue distribution and fee transparency which helps to ensure that the transaction fees are reasonable, affordable, and transparent for the users.
